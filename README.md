# Digital Timer

Pre-Lab Ideas

1.	Circuit Workout: A device that takes in two time parameters â€“ length of each set of the circuit and rest time between circuits. The device will then light up or make appropriate sounds to notify the user if they should start working out or stop and take a rest.
2.	Metronome: A device that takes in two time-related parameters: tempo (can be converted to time in between beats) and what type of time (3/4, 4/4, etc.) The device will then beat appropriately with the tempo and will add a special noise to the first beat of the time style (so as to make clear if it is 3/4, 4/4, etc.).
3.	Work Day: A personalized device for each employee. When arriving at work, you push the button and the timer will start. When you leave you, you push it again and the timer will stop. This will allow for proper reporting of time worked. 
4.	Marathon Runner: A device that takes in a number of miles and a specified value of time that the runner wants to be able to run the distance in. When the runner starts running, he or she pushes a button. The device will light up or make a sound every time the runner should have completed a quarter mile lap if he or she wants to stay on pace.
5.	Keep-Me-Awake: A device intended to keep you awake. A button is pushed and if it is not pushed every 30 minutes, it will make loud noises to wake you up. By pushing every 30 minutes, you are communicating to the device that you are still awake and do not need to be woken up.
6.	Heart Rate Monitor: Click a button. Start counting how many times your heart beats/your pulse. After 60 seconds, an alarm will sound or a light will flash and you will have measured your heart rate.
7.	Get Up and Stretch: When using a computer for a prolonged period of time, use this device. After initially hitting a button, the device will notify you through light or sound every hour so that you get up and stretch and look away from the screen.
8.	Eating Contest: With this device, an alarm will sound after a specified time. Within that time, each contestant clicks one of the buttons after each hot dog they eat (to keep score). This will determine who can eat the most hot dogs in a certain timeframe.
9.	Mental Clock: This device allows for a game. After initially hitting a button, you mentally try to count to 30 and hit the button to try to make the timer stop right at 30 seconds. The device will output how much time actually elapsed between the two presses and whoever gets closest wins the game. 
10.	 Dance Party: When prompted, a countdown will start. Once it hits zero, music will play and lights/visuals will accompany it, so that people present can dance. Once the song is over, it will prompt the dancers to see if they want to keep dancing. If they indicate they want to, the countdown will restart and the dancers can dance again to the music.

Include your responses to the bold questions below. Include snippets of code that explain what you did. Deliverables are due next Tuesday. Post your lab reports as README.md pages on your GitHub, and post a link to that on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Solder your LCD panel

**Take a picture of your soldered panel and add it here!**

## Part B. Writing to the LCD
 
**a. What voltage level do you need to power your display?**

**b. What voltage level do you need to power the display backlight?**
   
**c. What was one mistake you made when wiring up the display? How did you fix it?**

**d. What line of code do you need to change to make it flash your name instead of "Hello World"?**

Within the code, there is a line of code lcd.print("hello, world!") which determines what string value is being flashed on the LCD. Therefore in order to change what is flashing, you simply need to change the string inside of the paranthesees -- I changed it to lcd.print("hello, Bar!").
 
**e. Include a copy of your Lowly Multimeter code in your lab write-up.**

The code for my Lowly Multimeter and a video of it performing are below.

## Part C. Using a time-based digital sensor

**Upload a video of your working rotary encoder here.**

A video of my rotary encoder is below. As can be seen in the video, the output is meant to track the count of how many times you turn the knob. After experimenting with turning the knob in both directions, I realized the following: if you turn it one way, it will start counting up away from 0. However, if the knob is turned the other direction, it will jump from 0 to a value of 16383 and continue counting down until the direction of rotation is reversed again.

## Part D. Make your Arduino sing!

**a. How would you change the code to make the song play twice as fast?**

To achieve this, I tried two different methods. The first involved altering the following line of code: int noteDuration = 1000 / noteDurations[thisNote];. The second involved altering the following line of code instead: int pauseBetweenNotes = noteDuration * 1.30;. In each case, the way I altered the code was by dividing the noteDuration or the pauseBetweenNotes values by an additional factor of 2 (the rest of the answer will clarify which one of these alterations was actually correct).

My first test regarding these changes was to numerically measure if they produced the desired result. I added the line "Serial.begin(9600)" before the for loop and added the line "Serial.print(millis())" at the end of the for loop and ran the code for the above two scenarios and for one scenario where neither of the variables/durations were altered. For the unaltered scenario, the time output was 2276 milliseconds, while the altered scenarios had time outputs of 1134 and 1136 milliseconds. This confirmed for me that both methods technically sped the song up to be twice as fast.

However, after further examining the code, I realized that the melody[] array was accounting for rests/silence as well with values of 0. This meant that when dividing the noteDuration by 2, the notes AND rests were being divided by 2, which was the desired result. When actually playing the song, it sounded correct as well, so this was the correct way to make it play twice as fast. 

Dividing pauseBetweenNotes by 2, however, seems to just alter the space in between notes and not the actual value of the notes. Therefore, it squishes everything together. Although it cuts the time of the whole song in half, it does not sound correct when the program is run. This is why this alteration was not the correct choice.
 
**b. What song is playing?**

## Part E. Make your own timer

**a. Make a short video showing how your timer works, and what happens when time is up!**
